<knapsack.py>
This file contains two parts, 4.d and 4.extra credit. I separated two parts by comments. 

First half of the code is for problem 4.d implementing the 0-1 knapsack algorithm by using bottom-up dynamic programming. 

Second half is for the extra credit implementing an algorithm that finds the composition of an optimal subset from the table. 

I attached the data file, 'data.txt', in case you check the format of data this program is using.
